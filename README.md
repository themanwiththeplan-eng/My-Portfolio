# My Portfolio Site

## Why I Made This Site
The reason that I am making this site is to have an easy way to update something for future possible employers to look at and see the progress that I've made throughout
the time that I've been coding. Currently their aren't many projects that I have right now and I'm going to use this site to continue making more projects and update this 
site to link to them in the future.
